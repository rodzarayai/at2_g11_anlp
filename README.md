## Description
The CV Job Matcher App is a user-friendly, web-based platform designed to assist job seekers in finding relevant job opportunities by analyzing and matching their CVs with the latest job openings. The app provides personalized job recommendations by comparing the skills extracted from the uploaded CV against a pre-existing database of job descriptions using cosine similarity. Additionally, the app offers real-time insights into job market trends, such as the most in-demand positions and key skills that are trending.

## Key features include:

* Interactive Job Market Insights: Visualizations that provide insights into the most in-demand job positions and top skills required in the market.
* Personalized CV Matching: Users can upload their CVs in PDF format, and the app identifies relevant skills and compares them to job descriptions, returning the top 10 most relevant job matches.
* Specific Job Matching: The app allows users to input a specific job description and compare it against their CV, highlighting both matching skills and missing skills to help identify areas of improvement.
* Data Privacy: The app ensures user privacy by not storing or sharing any uploaded CVs. All data is processed temporarily in memory for comparison purposes.
