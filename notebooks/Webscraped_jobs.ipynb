Our best candidates will be skilled in conducting interviews for requirements elicitation. They will be able to quickly identify follow-up questions that must be answered, interpret responses, and effectively document business and operational processes. In later stages of the program, this person will develop testing scenarios for technical and user acceptance, participate in the testing of systems to verify functionality, provide assistance to the technical team, and provide training support during all phases of the system selection and implementation—candidates with technical writing skills are preferred. Most importantly, our best candidates will be friendly and approachable and able to foster essential business relationships with people of all backgrounds.\n",
